    "reasoning": "The paper is highly relevant to the Molecular Biology domain, focusing on the molecular mechanism of a monoclonal antibody (adintrevimab) against SARS-CoV-2. It discusses protein-protein and protein-compound interactions, gene/protein expression, and mechanisms of viral neutralization. The text contains multiple entity types (PROTEIN, COMPOUND, GENE, PATHWAY, MECHANISM, PHENOTYPE, CELLULAR_COMPONENT) and relationship types (BINDS, INHIBITS, ACTIVATES, PART_OF, REGULATES, LOCALIZES_TO). There are sufficient entities (antibodies, viral proteins, genes, compounds) and relationships (binding, inhibition, activation, regulation) to construct a meaningful knowledge graph. The paper avoids clinical/epidemiological focus and centers on molecular interactions and mechanisms.",
