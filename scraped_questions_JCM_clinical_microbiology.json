      "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of corticosteroid use presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and eosinophilia. Stool microscopy reveals both rhabditiform and filariform larvae. Rhabditiform larvae are the non-infective stage normally passed in stool, but a subset can develop into autoinfective filariform larvae (L3a) within the gut.

      "question": "A 62-year-old male farmer from a tropical region presents with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and intermittent eosinophilia. Stool microscopy detects motile larvae, and serological testing reveals high-titer IgG antibodies with high avidity. He is diagnosed with strongyloidiasis. Hookworm infection, caused by Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, is detected in 40% of stool samples from patients in similar tropical regions, often presenting with anemia and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. In co-infected individuals, eosinophil counts may fluctuate independently of Strongyloides stercoralis status. He has a history of corticosteroid use for COPD exacerbations. Ivermectin is unavailable due to supply shortages. Human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) co-infection has been shown to increase the risk of disseminated strongyloidiasis by up to 25-fold due to impaired cellular immunity. However, HTLV-1 serology was negative in this patient. Two alternative drugs are considered: albendazole and thiabendazole. Albendazole has moderate efficacy but fewer side effects, while thiabendazole is more effective than albendazole but associated with higher rates of adverse reactions. The patient has mild hepatic impairment but no contraindications to either drug. Which drug should be selected as the alternative to ivermectin for this patient to maximize efficacy against Strongyloides stercoralis?",

      "question": "A 32-year-old patient with newly diagnosed Crohn\u2019s disease presents with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Initial laboratory tests show elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 28 mg/L (normal <5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 45 mm/hr (normal <20 mm/hr), and fecal calprotectin (FCP) at 950 \u03bcg/g (normal <50 \u03bcg/g). CRP levels can transiently increase following minor infections or tissue injury, even in patients with stable Crohn\u2019s disease. In some cases, CRP may normalize within days after resolution of non-intestinal inflammatory triggers. Colonoscopy reveals multiple endoscopic ulcerations throughout the colon and terminal ileum. Endoscopic findings can reveal mucosal healing or persistent ulcerations, with studies showing that up to 40% of asymptomatic Crohn\u2019s patients may still have active lesions on colonoscopy. The severity of endoscopic findings does not always correlate with clinical symptoms or serum inflammatory markers. Biopsy confirms active mucosal inflammation without granulomas. Colonoscopy typically requires bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol, which can transiently alter the gut microbiota composition for up to 48 hours. In Crohn\u2019s disease, colonoscopy may reveal skip lesions and aphthous ulcers even in asymptomatic patients. The patient is started on corticosteroids (CS) and immunomodulator (IM) therapy. After 8 weeks, symptoms improve, CRP decreases to 7 mg/L, ESR to 18 mm/hr, but FCP remains elevated at 600 \u03bcg/g. The patient is asymptomatic but repeat colonoscopy shows persistent endoscopic ulcerations. Which marker best indicates ongoing active intestinal inflammation in this patient?",

Two management options are considered: (A) Early initiation of immunomodulator therapy within 2 weeks of diagnosis, or (B) No immunomodulator therapy for the first 6 months. Endoscopic findings at baseline revealed mild segmental erythema and aphthous ulcers in the terminal ileum, with a mean SES-CD score of 4, which is consistent with moderate mucosal inflammation in Crohn\u2019s disease. In similar cohorts, endoscopic improvement at 6 months was observed in 40% of patients regardless of initial FCP levels. Studies show that early immunomodulator therapy increases the odds of belonging to a favorable FCP trajectory class (FCP <150 \u03bcg/g at 6 months) in 70% of patients, while delayed or no therapy results in only 30% achieving this target. Endoscopic outcome scores at 6 months were similar between patients with normalized FCP and those with persistent elevation, with mucosal healing observed in 60% and 55% of cases, respectively. Endoscopic outcome is not always directly correlated with fecal calprotectin levels in Crohn\u2019s disease. However, the patient\u2019s stool also tests positive for high levels of bacterial flagellin antigen, which is hypothesized to trigger increased FCP via innate immune activation in susceptible individuals. Disease location, such as isolated ileal versus ileocolonic involvement, can result in up to a 40% difference in baseline fecal calprotectin levels, independent of overall disease activity. In some cohorts, patients with colonic disease show higher FCP values than those with purely ileal disease. In a cohort, patients with high fecal flagellin and no immunomodulator therapy had persistent FCP elevation (>400 \u03bcg/g at 6 months) in 80% of cases, while those with early immunomodulator therapy and high flagellin had normalization of FCP (<150 \u03bcg/g) in 65% of cases.

In patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, fecal calprotectin levels may fluctuate widely, with some individuals exhibiting values as low as 80 \u03bcg/g during mild disease activity. Crohn\u2019s disease can also present with intermittent episodes of watery diarrhea, complicating differentiation from infectious etiologies. Laboratory results show fecal calprotectin level of 120 \u03bcg/g (normal <50 \u03bcg/g). Clostridium difficile infection is characterized by toxin-mediated colitis and can present with fecal calprotectin levels ranging from 100 to over 500 \u03bcg/g. In multiplex GI PCR panels, C. difficile is routinely tested alongside other enteric pathogens to aid in differential diagnosis. The patient has no history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or recent NSAID use. Blood leukocyte count is normal. The clinician must distinguish between infectious diarrhea and IBD flare. Considering that infectious diarrhea can cause moderate elevation of fecal calprotectin due to neutrophil infiltration, but IBD typically causes much higher elevations (>250 \u03bcg/g), which biomarker or test result best supports infectious diarrhea as the cause of symptoms in this patient?",

Laboratory results show: fecal calprotectin 950 \u03bcg/g (normal <50 \u03bcg/g), C-reactive protein (CRP) 8 mg/L (normal <5 mg/L), hemoglobin 10. Clostridium difficile was not detected in the patient's stool by PCR, and toxin assays remained negative throughout the evaluation. Recent studies show that C. difficile colonization rates in ulcerative colitis patients can reach up to 15%, especially during disease flares. 2 g/dL (normal 13-17 g/dL), and platelet count 420,000/\u03bcL (normal 150,000-400,000/\u03bcL). Anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs, such as infliximab and adalimumab, achieve peak serum concentrations within 1-2 weeks of intravenous administration. In clinical microbiology studies, these agents do not exhibit direct antimicrobial activity against common enteric pathogens. Flexible sigmoidoscopy reveals continuous mucosal erythema and ulcerations from the rectum to the sigmoid colon. Anti-TNF treatment has been shown to reduce mucosal TNF-alpha levels by approximately 70% within 4 weeks of initiation in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. However, serum drug concentrations can vary widely depending on individual pharmacokinetics. Biopsy confirms active mucosal inflammation with crypt abscesses. The patient is currently on oral mesalazine but has not responded after 8 weeks of therapy. Which next-line therapy should be initiated to most effectively induce clinical remission and mucosal healing in this patient?",

      "question": "A hospital laboratory is evaluating two diagnostic assays for detecting human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with acute lower respiratory infections. Assay A detects the HMPV glycoprotein ectodomain using a monoclonal antibody, with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was also detected in 18% of the nasopharyngeal specimens from this cohort, with peak incidence observed in children under two years of age. RSV RNA quantification by RT-PCR showed a median viral load of 4.2 \u00d7 10^5 copies/mL in positive samples. Assay B detects HMPV RNA using RT-PCR targeting the nucleoprotein gene, with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 97%. The REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION (RT)-PCR PROTOCOL, developed by the CDC, can simultaneously detect multiple respiratory viruses in a single reaction with a reported analytical sensitivity as low as 10 RNA copies per reaction. This protocol is routinely used in reference laboratories for surveillance of viral respiratory pathogens. In a cohort of 1,000 patients, 150 are true HMPV cases. Real-time PCR assays can quantify viral load in nasopharyngeal specimens, with detection limits as low as 10 copies per reaction under optimal conditions.

      "question": "A clinical trial evaluates four interventions for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in high-risk infants: (A) monthly palivizumab injections (a monoclonal antibody targeting the F protein), (B) a single dose of nirsevimab (a long-acting monoclonal antibody that neutralizes RSV by blocking viral entry), (C) an inactivated RSV vaccine administered to infants at 2 and 4 months, and (D) maternal immunization with a prefusion F protein-based vaccine during pregnancy. The alum-precipitated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine demonstrated a robust antibody response in 80% of recipients during field trials, although its efficacy in preventing severe RSV disease varied across age groups. Data show: (1) palivizumab reduces RSV hospitalization by 55% but requires monthly dosing; (2) nirsevimab reduces RSV hospitalization by 75% with a single dose; (3) the inactivated RSV vaccine in infants does not reduce RSV hospitalization and is associated with enhanced disease; (4) maternal immunization reduces infant RSV hospitalization by 60% in the first 3 months of life. REGN2222, another monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV F protein, showed a 45% reduction in RSV infection rates in animal models but failed to significantly decrease hospitalization rates in phase 3 trials with preterm infants. The RSV F protein undergoes a conformational change during viral entry, with prefusion-specific antibodies showing up to 80% higher neutralization potency compared to postfusion-targeting antibodies. In clinical isolates, mutations in the F protein are detected in approximately 5% of cases but rarely impact monoclonal antibody binding.

        "Human monoclonal antibodies administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg have been shown to achieve peak serum concentrations within 24 hours in RSV-infected patients. In influenza studies, these antibodies demonstrate high binding affinity (KD < 1 nM) to hemagglutinin, though their effect on viral shedding duration varies.",
        "Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, reduces influenza viral shedding by approximately 70% when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset, but has no direct effect on RSV replication in vitro.",
        "High-affinity antibodies against RSV antigens are detected at titers exceeding 1:10,000 in convalescent plasma samples, indicating robust neutralization capacity. In influenza infection, high-affinity antibodies targeting the HA stalk region correlate with reduced viral shedding but do not directly inhibit viral entry."

      "question": "A clinical laboratory receives nasopharyngeal swabs from three pediatric patients with acute respiratory symptoms. All samples are inoculated onto cell cultures. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can induce cytopathic effect in HEp-2 cell cultures within 48 to 72 hours, with syncytia formation observed in over 80% of positive samples. RSV RNA is detectable by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs even when CPE is absent. After 72 hours, two cultures show cytopathic effect (CPE), while one does not. CaCo-2 cells, commonly used for respiratory virus isolation, demonstrate a cytopathic effect in approximately 85% of parainfluenza virus-positive cultures within 72 hours. However, their sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus is significantly lower compared to other cell lines. RT-PCR is performed on all samples: the two CPE-positive cultures are positive for parainfluenza virus RNA, while the CPE-negative culture is negative for parainfluenza virus but positive for rhinovirus RNA. Acute bronchiolitis due to other infectious organisms, such as adenovirus or parainfluenza virus, accounts for approximately 20% of pediatric bronchiolitis cases in some hospital cohorts. Severity scores for these cases can vary, with parainfluenza-associated bronchiolitis often presenting with moderate respiratory distress. The hospital is considering two interventions: (A) administering a trivalent parainfluenza virus vaccine to all pediatric inpatients, or (B) using CPE in cell culture as the sole diagnostic criterion for parainfluenza virus infection. Based on the data provided, which intervention is more likely to prevent future parainfluenza virus infections in this population?",

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "CPE in cell culture indicates active viral replication, but is not specific to parainfluenza virus.",
        "RT-PCR confirms parainfluenza virus only in CPE-positive samples, but CPE can also be caused by other viruses.",
        "One sample with CPE is negative for parainfluenza virus, showing CPE is not exclusive.",
        "The trivalent vaccine is designed to induce immunity against multiple parainfluenza virus serotypes.",
        "Vaccination prevents infection by generating protective immunity, not just detecting current infection.",
        "Using CPE alone as a diagnostic tool does not prevent infection, only identifies some cases.",
        "Therefore, vaccination is the intervention that actively prevents future infections."
