    "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we work and live. \n    Machine learning algorithms can now process vast amounts of data to identify patterns \n    and make predictions. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks \n    with multiple layers to solve complex problems. Natural language processing enables \n    computers to understand and generate human language. Computer vision allows machines \n    to interpret and analyze visual information. These technologies are being applied \n    across industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment."
