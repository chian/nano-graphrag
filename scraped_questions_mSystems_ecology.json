      "question": "Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 is exposed to high ammonium (NH4+) concentrations, triggering osmotic stress. Nitrogen regulatory protein P-II levels increase by approximately 2-fold in Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 when exposed to elevated ammonium, modulating the activity of several nitrogen transporters without directly altering glutamate synthesis rates. Under these conditions, strain SC2 upregulates glutamine synthetase and GS-GOGAT, both of which increase glutamate synthesis. In strain SC2, intracellular glutamine levels increase by approximately 40% when exposed to elevated ammonium, reflecting enhanced nitrogen assimilation. However, this rise does not correlate with changes in cell volume under osmotic stress. GDH also contributes to glutamate production from ammonia. Hybrid cluster protein (Hcp) expression increases 2.5-fold in Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 when exposed to high ammonium, reflecting its role in hydroxylamine detoxification. However, Hcp activity does not directly alter glutamate synthesis rates under these conditions. Glutamate acts as a compatible solute for osmoregulation and as a key nitrogen donor for biosynthetic processes. If you must select the most critical molecular process enabling strain SC2 to simultaneously mitigate osmotic stress and assimilate nitrogen under high ammonium, which process should you choose?",

      "question": "A freshwater ecosystem contains methanotrophic bacteria that express particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). When exposed to high ammonium (NH4+) concentrations (10 mM), these bacteria oxidize ammonia via pMMO, producing hydroxylamine as a toxic intermediate. Ammonia concentrations above 5 mM have been shown to inhibit the growth of certain freshwater methanotrophs, although some strains maintain methane oxidation rates under these conditions. In parallel, ammonia can also serve as an alternative electron donor for denitrifying bacteria present in the ecosystem. Methylocystis, a dominant methanotroph, must detoxify hydroxylamine to survive. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) activity in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria increases twofold when ammonium concentrations exceed 5 mM, with the haoAB operon showing peak expression after 12 hours of exposure. Some methanotrophs possess a variant HAO that can reduce hydroxylamine to ammonia, though its efficiency varies between strains. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the same ecosystem use ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) to oxidize ammonia, also producing hydroxylamine, which they convert to nitrite. Ammonia (NH3) concentrations in freshwater ecosystems can reach up to 5 mM following agricultural runoff, and NH3 competes with methane for the pMMO active site in methanotrophs, reducing methane oxidation rates by up to 40%. If the ecosystem experiences a sudden increase in nitrate (NO3\u2212) to 20 mM, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction by abiotic processes begins, selectively producing hydroxylamine as an intermediate. Considering all biological and abiotic pathways, which molecule will accumulate to the highest toxic concentration, potentially limiting both methanotroph and AOB activity?",

      "question": "A wetland microcosm contains two methanotrophic populations: Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. Nitrifying bacteria present in wetland soils can generate up to 5 \u03bcM N2O via nitrifier denitrification under similar low oxygen conditions, although their activity is typically lower than that of methanotrophs in microcosm experiments. Under high ammonium (NH4+) and low oxygen (O2 < 2%), SC2 produces N2O as a byproduct of nitrogen metabolism, but also possesses nitrous oxide reductase, enabling it to reduce N2O to N2. Clade II NosZ, present in some Methylocystis strains, exhibits N2O reduction rates up to 0.8 \u03bcmol N2O per hour under microaerobic conditions. This variant is distinguished by an additional c-type heme domain, which may influence electron transfer efficiency. OB3b produces N2O via hydroxylamine oxidation but lacks nitrous oxide reductase. The nosZ gene, located on plasmid pBSC2-2 in Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, is expressed at similar levels under both high and low ammonium conditions. In previous studies, nosZ transcript abundance correlated with N2O reduction rates but did not affect overall cell growth. After 48 hours, N2O concentrations are measured: in the SC2-only microcosm, N2O peaks at 10 \u03bcM and then declines to 2 \u03bcM; in the OB3b-only microcosm, N2O rises steadily to 15 \u03bcM. In a mixed microcosm (equal cell numbers), N2O peaks at 12 \u03bcM and then drops to 3 \u03bcM. Which population is primarily responsible for net N2O consumption in the mixed microcosm?",

Glutamate also serves as a precursor for several other amino acids under osmotic stress conditions. 1 M to 0. 8 M. Escherichia coli, under similar osmotic stress conditions, accumulates proline to intracellular concentrations exceeding 80 mM, primarily through upregulation of the proU operon. However, its proline synthesis is less sensitive to external ammonium fluctuations compared to some soil bacteria.

      "question": "In a freshwater wetland, nitrate (NO3\u207b) pollution is being remediated using three different electrocatalytic substrates: bare carbon nanotubes (CNTs), ZnPc MDE, and ZnPc AE. Under identical conditions, bare CNTs achieve 88% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 production via NO3RR, ZnPc MDE achieves 62% FE, and ZnPc AE achieves 36% FE. COPC MDE, a cobalt phthalocyanine-based electrocatalyst supported on CNTs, achieves 75% Faradaic efficiency for NH2OHRR at potentials 0.2 V less negative than ZnPc MDE. In wetland microcosms, COPC MDE maintains stable activity over 48 hours without significant substrate degradation. ZnPc MDE also catalyzes NH2OHRR, producing NH3 from NH2OH, while bare CNTs do not catalyze NH2OHRR. Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) concentrations in wetlands can reach up to 20 \u00b5M during peak ammonia oxidation, with transient spikes observed following heavy rainfall events. NH2OH is rapidly detoxified by methanotrophs to prevent accumulation and cellular toxicity. The wetland contains high concentrations of both NO3\u207b and NH2OH. At an applied potential of \u22120.55\u2009V, all three substrates maintain stable current densities, but only ZnPc MDE shows a slight increase in hydrogen evolution. Potential adjustments above \u22120.60\u2009V do not significantly alter the selectivity for NH3 over competing products.

During fertilizer runoff events, NH3 concentrations in the wetland can spike to levels exceeding 10 mM, which is sufficient to alter the activity of several nitrogen-transforming microbial enzymes. NH3 also serves as a substrate for nitrification, supporting the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in these environments. Strain N expresses only soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), which oxidizes methane but cannot oxidize ammonia. During high ammonia periods, hydroxylamine concentrations in the wetland can transiently reach up to 0.5 mM, as measured in similar ecosystems with active pMMO-expressing bacteria. Hydroxylamine is rapidly converted to nitrous oxide (N2O) by some microbial communities, contributing to trace gas emissions. The wetland receives periodic fertilizer runoff, increasing ammonia concentrations to 10 mM for 48 hours every week. During fertilizer runoff events, NH4 (ammonium) concentrations in the wetland can reach levels above 8 mM, providing an abundant nitrogen source for microbial assimilation.

Soil analyses revealed that concentrations of essential nutrients (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P) varied by up to 20% between greenhouse plots, with phosphorus showing the highest variability. Despite these fluctuations, all measured levels remained within the optimal range for Alkanna tinctoria growth. Only acclimatized plants survive transplantation to greenhouse soil and reach maturity. In parallel trials, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased phosphorus uptake in Alkanna tinctoria roots by 40%, though total root biomass remained unchanged.

      "question": "A marine ecologist is studying lipid production in different organisms and sample types. Sulfitobacter, a marine bacterium, synthesizes phospholipids, aminolipids, and unknown lipid-like features as part of its lipid metabolism. Phytoplankton produce lipids for energy storage and membrane structure, with production influenced by nutrient availability. CB-A, a Sulfitobacter strain lysogenized with U-A prophage, shows a 15% increase in aminolipid abundance compared to its non-lysogenized parent under standard laboratory conditions. This strain is routinely used to assess prophage-mediated modulation of host lipid pathways. Mammalian tissue produces a diverse array of lipids for metabolic and structural functions. Biofluids transport lipids reflecting systemic metabolic states. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) accounts for approximately 25-30% of total phospholipids in Sulfitobacter membranes, and its abundance can be quantified using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. In olsA mutant strains, PE levels remain comparable to wild type, despite alterations in other aminolipid species. Lipid biosynthesis intermediates are precursors for various lipid classes in bacterial cells. Lipidomics analysis provides quantitative and qualitative data on lipid profiles. The abundance of unknown lipid-like features in Sulfitobacter increases by approximately 40% when exposed to phage infection, although their exact structural roles remain uncharacterized. These molecules are detected at variable levels depending on the substrate provided during culture. The ecologist wants to identify the most direct biological source of lipids that would reflect changes in Sulfitobacter\u2019s membrane composition under varying environmental conditions, without confounding influences from other organisms or systemic transport.

Sulfitobacter\u2019s carbon metabolism produces a diverse array of intracellular metabolites.

However, the overall impact on metabolite profiles depends on both phage type and host metabolic state. CB-A cells, when grown on glutamate or acetate, show increased production and accumulation of metabolites, especially after lytic events. Prophage induction in Sulfitobacter can be triggered by UV exposure, resulting in a 2- to 5-fold increase in phage particles and subsequent host cell lysis within 24 hours. This process does not alter the baseline metabolic activity of non-lysogenic cells. Escherichia coli consumes metabolites as substrates for growth. Lambdoid prophages integrated in Escherichia coli genomes can be induced by environmental stressors, leading to a 2- to 5-fold increase in phage particle release during the lytic cycle. This induction can transiently alter host metabolic profiles without significantly changing overall cell viability. When cell lysis occurs in the community, the diversity and abundance of environmental metabolites increase, supporting the metabolic needs of surviving cells.

During infection, AMGs are expressed and modulate host metabolism. The dcm gene, present in both HTVC023P-type and HTVC019P-type phages, is expressed at similar levels during infection and leads to a 2-fold increase in host DNA methylation. Despite its abundance, dcm activity does not alter the overall burst size of either viral lineage. In nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) waters, SAR11 growth is limited by nucleotide availability. The queC gene, present in some marine phages, catalyzes a key step in queuosine biosynthesis and is upregulated twofold during infection of SAR11 under oligotrophic conditions. However, queC expression does not significantly alter the overall tRNA modification profile in the host during short-term infection. Viral fitness is measured by burst size (virions per cell): HTVC023P-type Pelagiphages achieve a burst size of 120, while HTVC019P-type phages achieve a burst size of 60.

      "question": "A newly discovered marine virus infects SAR11 bacteria and carries a set of colocated auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA hypermodification, and Curli biogenesis. These genes are always found together in the viral genome and are expressed simultaneously during infection. In deep ocean samples, auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) are detected in approximately 18% of viral genomes, with their abundance varying seasonally and by water column depth. Notably, AMGs involved in nucleotide metabolism are most frequently observed in surface waters during phytoplankton blooms. Experimental evidence shows that viruses with these colocated AMGs increase host nucleotide synthesis, modify host DNA to resist host restriction enzymes, and induce Curli fiber production, which enhances biofilm formation. HTVC023P-type clades display up to 40% genomic divergence between subgroups, with some clades predominating in coastal waters while others are more abundant in open ocean environments. Members of these clades can reach relative abundances of 10^4 to 10^5 viral particles per milliliter in peak seasons. Three viral groups are being compared: (1) HTVC023P-type Pelagiphages, which always encode these colocated partner-AMGs; (2) Pelagiphages in general, which may or may not encode partner-AMGs; (3) Other marine viruses, which lack these AMGs entirely. HTVC023P-type Pelagiphage populations are most abundant in surface ocean waters, with clade V representing approximately 40% of detected sequences in some regions. Despite their prevalence, these phages display variable infection rates depending on host density and environmental conditions. Which viral group is most likely to consistently coordinate manipulation of host nucleotide metabolism, DNA protection, and biofilm formation during infection?",

Curli fibers are extracellular protein structures involved in biofilm formation in some bacteria, but their assembly requires periplasmic export of curli subunits. The Type VIII Secretion System (T8SS, Curli) can be horizontally transferred via phage genomes, with recent studies showing up to 12% of marine bacteriophage isolates carrying T8SS-related genes. In some environments, T8SS activity has been correlated with increased aggregation rates, independent of nutrient availability. In a marine microcosm, two Pelagibacter strains are compared: Strain A has a functional SecYEG complex, while Strain B has a nonfunctional SecYEG due to a point mutation. Curli expression in Pelagibacter strains is upregulated twofold in the presence of dissolved organic carbon, although total curli protein levels remain below those observed in E. coli under similar conditions.

Despite their abundance, SAR11 genomes typically contain fewer than 1,500 protein-coding genes. They compare two approaches: (1) a culture-independent metagenomic sequencing approach, which detects viral sequences directly from seawater samples but cannot link viruses to specific hosts, and (2) a culture-dependent approach, which involves isolating Pelagibacter hosts, infecting them with environmental viral concentrates, and sequencing any resulting pelagiphages. Among the newly sequenced pelagiphages, 41 previously unknown auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified, including several involved in nucleotide metabolism and Curli biogenesis. The relative abundance of AMGs varied by sampling site, with some environments yielding up to 15 distinct AMGs per isolate. The culture-dependent approach enabled the isolation and sequencing of ten new pelagiphages from diverse marine environments, each confirmed to infect Pelagibacter. Phylogenetic analysis of the newly sequenced pelagiphages revealed that 70% clustered within previously uncharacterized clades, based on DNA polymerase gene sequences.

      "question": "In a thawed permafrost ecosystem, three microbial populations are present: (A) Fungi, (B) RNA viruses, and (C) Bacterial plant pathogens. Fungi produce polygalacturonase enzymes to degrade plant cell walls, facilitating nutrient acquisition. Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are present in thawed permafrost plant roots at concentrations averaging 15 \u00b5g/g fresh weight, where they can reduce fungal polygalacturonase activity by up to 60% in vitro. However, PGIP expression levels remain unchanged after permafrost thaw according to recent transcriptomic analyses. RNA viruses encode auxiliary metabolic genes for polygalacturonase, potentially influencing carbon cycling by increasing plant cell wall degradation. Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are expressed in thawed permafrost plants at levels comparable to pre-thaw conditions, with PGIP activity reducing fungal polygalacturonase efficiency by approximately 20%. PGIP concentrations remain stable despite the observed decrease in pectin content. Bacterial plant pathogens also secrete polygalacturonases as virulence factors, but their population is 10-fold lower than fungi and viruses. Plant polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are present at baseline levels in this ecosystem, with OsPGIP1 expression remaining unchanged after permafrost thaw.

      "question": "A researcher is investigating the primary ecological source responsible for the initial emergence and broad dissemination of a novel antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) found in both human gut microbiomes and food animal microbiomes. The gene is detected in multiple bacterial species, including telluric bacteria from agricultural soils, intestinal multidrug-resistant bacteria, and bacteria carrying conjugative plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Microbial communities in manure-amended soils exhibit a 2-fold increase in overall plasmid abundance compared to untreated soils, with horizontal gene transfer rates peaking during periods of high microbial activity. The gene is not yet cataloged in any curated database. In recent surveys, the animal gut microbiome of cattle has been shown to harbor over 200 distinct antibiotic resistance genes, with horizontal gene transfer rates estimated at 1.2 events per 10^6 cells per hour. Notably, these microbial communities maintain stable diversity even after dietary changes. The researcher notes that the gene is present in soil samples from fields treated with manure, and that telluric bacteria can transfer the gene to gut bacteria via conjugative plasmids. Municipal wastewater samples from nearby urban centers contained up to 10^5 copies/mL of various antibiotic resistance genes, with microplastic-associated biofilms facilitating horizontal gene transfer among resident bacteria. However, the specific ARG under investigation was not detected in these wastewater samples during the initial screening. In subsequent animal feeding trials, animals exposed to soil-derived bacteria rapidly acquire the ARG in their gut microbiome, and the gene is later found in human gut metagenomes of individuals consuming products from these animals.

      "question": "In a human gut ecosystem, three bacterial species are present: Species A (commensal, harbors plasmids with antibiotic resistance genes), Species B (pathogenic, lacks resistance genes but can acquire plasmids via conjugation), and Species C (commensal, contains transposons but no resistance genes). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids and transposons can transfer between species via horizontal gene transfer. Insertion sequences are present at an average of 10 copies per genome in these bacterial species, enabling frequent genomic rearrangements. However, their movement does not always result in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Over 48 hours, antibiotic exposure selects for resistance. Escherichia coli populations in the human gut can increase by up to 40% within 24 hours of antibiotic exposure, with plasmid uptake rates averaging 1.2 events per cell per day. This rapid expansion is often accompanied by elevated expression of efflux pump genes. Species A transfers plasmids to Species B, conferring resistance, while transposons from Species C do not carry resistance genes and are not transferred. Klebsiella pneumoniae, when present in the gut microbiome, can increase its population density by up to 40% within 24 hours under antibiotic pressure, although its plasmid transfer rates remain unaffected by short-term exposure.

      "question": "A researcher is investigating which host metabolic pathway most directly influences the composition of vaginal microbiota through modulation of local inflammation. Retinol metabolism is upregulated twofold in cervical tissue during lesion progression, influencing local immune cell differentiation but not directly altering inflammatory mediator levels in the vaginal environment. Three host pathways are considered: (1) Tryptophan metabolism, which contributes to amino acid catabolism; (2) Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, reflecting endogenous amino acid metabolism; (3) Arachidonic acid metabolism, which is primarily carried out by the host and has implications for inflammation and disease processes. Analysis of the vaginal metabolome reveals that lactic acid concentrations can vary by up to 40% between individuals, independent of host inflammatory status. In addition, levels of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate are positively correlated with overall microbial diversity in the vaginal environment. The researcher notes that increased local inflammation alters microbial persistence and evolution. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate and butyrate, are detected at concentrations up to 2 mM in vaginal secretions and have been shown to modulate epithelial barrier function independently of host metabolic pathways. In some studies, SCFA levels correlate with shifts in microbial diversity, though their primary source is microbial fermentation rather than host metabolism.

In vitro, G. vaginalis demonstrates stable growth rates across pH values from 5.0 to 6.5. Her vaginal metabolic profile shows high lactic acid, moderate tryptophan metabolites, and low arachidonic acid derivatives. Candida species can increase their cell wall chitin content by up to 40% in response to elevated vaginal pH, although this adaptation does not directly alter lactic acid production.

      "question": "A researcher is investigating how two factors\u2014food substrate and fecal metagenome analysis\u2014impact the identification of disease-specific microbial signatures in the human gut microbiome.

Multi-omics data from gut microbiome studies have revealed that integrating metabolomic and proteomic profiles can uncover up to 40% more functional pathways than metagenomic data alone. However, these approaches often require larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance. For each sample, she performs metagenomic sequencing to profile microbial composition and function. Dietary patterns in the studied cohort showed a 40% prevalence of mixed macronutrient intake, with participants consuming both plant and animal-derived foods.

In the BIOME study, participants consuming a high-fibre plant-based diet showed a 25% increase in fecal butyrate concentrations after four weeks, regardless of baseline microbiome diversity. This intervention included at least 30 different plant foods per week.

The cycling of extracellular DNA in temperate grasslands can result in up to 20% of total soil DNA being rapidly degraded or taken up by microbes within 48 hours after release. This process also facilitates horizontal gene transfer among soil bacteria, especially following environmental disturbances. A researcher wants to estimate the current microbial diversity in the soil. Agaricomycetes DNA can persist in soil for up to six months after fungal cell death, and their relative abundance in sequencing data may increase by 20% following a major disturbance such as drought. She can choose between two protocols: Protocol A extracts all DNA (intracellular, eDNA, and relic DNA), while Protocol B uses a DNase treatment to remove eDNA and relic DNA, leaving only intracellular DNA. Dead cells can persist in soil for up to several weeks before complete lysis, with their DNA contributing up to 25% of the total exDNA pool in post-disturbance environments. The rate at which dead cell DNA degrades is influenced by soil moisture and temperature. If the soil has recently experienced a drought that killed 40% of the microbial community, and relic DNA persists for months, which protocol will provide a more accurate estimate of the living microbial community's current diversity?",

      "question": "A plant species is exposed to two different soil bacterial communities. Community A contains bacteria that produce peptidoglycan as a major cell wall component, which is recognized by the plant\u2019s immune receptors and triggers a mild immune response, leading to 10% reduction in plant growth. Nod factor, a lipochitooligosaccharide produced by rhizobium bacteria, can induce nodule formation in legume roots within 48 hours of exposure, but its signaling does not alter the plant\u2019s basal immune response to peptidoglycan. Community B contains bacteria that lack peptidoglycan but instead produce lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), which are known to promote plant root development and suppress immune activation, resulting in a 20% increase in plant growth. Mutualistic symbioses between plants and soil microbes can increase drought tolerance by up to 25% through improved water uptake and stress signaling. In some cases, these interactions also enhance resistance to certain soil-borne pathogens. Both communities provide equal levels of nitrogen fixation. Both bacterial communities also release autoinducers into the soil, with concentrations reaching up to 200 nM during peak growth phases, facilitating quorum sensing among resident microbes. Studies show that autoinducer levels do not directly alter plant immune receptor activation in this context.

      "question": "A population of pigs is exposed to Salmonella infection. Blood samples are collected from each pig at three ages: 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks. Short-lived effector cells (SLECs), identified by their CD127- KLRG1+ phenotype, typically comprise about 40% of the total CD8+ T-cell population during peak immune responses in swine. Despite their high cytolytic activity, SLECs show limited persistence beyond the acute phase of infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these samples are stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in vitro. At 8 weeks, the frequency of memory precursor effector cells (MPECs; CD127+ KLRG1-) increases by approximately 20% compared to 2 weeks, although their cytokine output remains lower than that of terminal effector cells. MPECs are known to preferentially survive and differentiate into long-lived memory cells following antigen clearance. Cytokine production is measured and found to be highest at 8 weeks, moderate at 24 weeks, and lowest at 2 weeks. In murine models, CD8+ T cell populations typically expand by approximately 2-fold following exposure to bacterial antigens, with both na\u00efve and memory subsets detectable in peripheral blood. This expansion is often accompanied by transient increases in surface activation markers such as CD69 and CD25. Flow cytometry reveals that the majority of cytokine-producing cells are CD8\u03b2+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis shows that effector CD8+ T cells (Teff) are the predominant cytokine producers at 8 weeks, while at 2 weeks, their frequency is low.

      "question": "A group of 40 pigs from DB Gen\u00e9tica Su\u00edna are divided into two equal cohorts. Cohort A is raised in a conventional indoor facility with slatted floors and receives a standard grain-based diet. Both cohorts received diets formulated to provide equal digestible energy, with each ration standardized to 3,200 kcal/kg to ensure comparable energy intake across treatments. Digestible energy levels were verified by near-infrared spectroscopy prior to the trial. Cohort B is raised outdoors on pasture, allowed to root naturally, and receives a mixed diet of grains and forage. Salmonella typhimurium colonization rates in pigs can reach up to 60% following oral challenge, with peak shedding typically observed between days 3 and 7 post-infection. In some studies, the bacterium has been shown to alter the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the gut by up to 15%.

Additionally, AMG abundance peaks during late summer, coinciding with increased viral diversity. Myoviridae expresses a diverse set of AMGs, enabling influence over host metabolic processes and participation in multiple KEGG pathways. During peak bloom, dsrA transcripts increase by 40% in surface waters, correlating with elevated ATP production but not altering overall microbial abundance. Sulfur phages specifically carry AMGs for sulfur oxidation and disproportionation, delivered to host cells during infection. Sulfur phages exhibit a 40% increase in genome replication rates when host cells are exposed to elevated sulfate concentrations. In hypersaline environments, these phages can persist for up to 72 hours outside host cells before losing infectivity.
