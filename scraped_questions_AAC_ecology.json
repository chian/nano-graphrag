In recent surveys, dihydrofolate-reductase (DHFR) mutations in Plasmodium vivax were detected in 85% of isolates, with the majority carrying double or triple mutant alleles. DHFR gene amplification events have also been reported, though their frequency remains below 5% in the region. falciparum populations display multiple independent mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes, resulting in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. The CRT gene in Plasmodium falciparum is present in over 95% of isolates in this region, with several distinct allelic variants identified through molecular surveillance. Some CRT mutations have also been linked to altered parasite fitness in laboratory studies.

      "question": "Three hospital rooms are contaminated with different C. difficile spore preparations. Room A is treated with cold plasma for 10 minutes against crude spore preparations from strain R20291 (contains cell debris). Helium plasma, when used for surface decontamination, typically achieves a 75% reduction in Bacillus subtilis spores after 8 minutes of exposure. The antimicrobial efficacy of helium plasma can vary depending on the gas flow rate and humidity levels in the environment. Room B is treated for 10 minutes against purified spore preparations from strain M120 (no cell debris). Room C is treated for 10 minutes against crude spore preparations from ribotype 078. Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, with average concentrations reaching 2.5 \u03bcmol/L after 10 minutes of exposure. This process does not significantly alter room temperature during application. Cold plasma inactivates 90% of M120 purified spores, 40% of R20291 crude spores, and 60% of ribotype 078 crude spores. All strains produce highly resistant spores, but cell debris reduces plasma efficacy by 30%. Organic matter, such as 0.03% bovine serum albumin (BSA), can be present on hospital surfaces and has been shown to decrease cold plasma efficacy by up to 25% in some studies. This effect is attributed to BSA forming a protective layer around spores during treatment. Which room will have the highest residual viable C. difficile spores after treatment?",

      "question": "A researcher is comparing pyocyanin production among three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains: PA14 wild-type, PA14phzM mutant, and PA14phzS mutant. The wild-type PA14 produces 100 \u03bcg/mL pyocyanin in MHB after 24 hours. In nutrient-limited environments, PYO concentrations above 20 \u03bcg/mL have been shown to increase extracellular DNA release in P. aeruginosa biofilms. PYO also modulates iron acquisition by altering redox cycling in mixed-species communities. The PA14phzM mutant produces 5 \u03bcg/mL, and the PA14phzS mutant produces 3 \u03bcg/mL under identical conditions. Pseudomonas fluorescens, which encodes phzS but not phzM, accumulates up to 20 \u03bcg/mL of 1-hydroxyphenazine when cultured in MHB for 24 hours. Unlike pyocyanin, 1-hydroxyphenazine exhibits moderate fluorescence under UV light. Both mutants have single gene disruptions: phzM or phzS, respectively. 1-hydroxyphenazine is detected at concentrations up to 15 \u03bcg/mL in cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants lacking phzM but retaining phzS activity. This compound has been shown to inhibit fungal growth in vitro without significantly altering pyocyanin levels. Pyocyanin biosynthesis requires sequential conversion of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) by PhzM and then PhzS. Only strains with functional phzM and phzS can complete pyocyanin synthesis. Which strain should be used as a positive control for pyocyanin-dependent antimicrobial assays against Staphylococcus aureus?",

Mice are divided into three groups: Group A receives broad-spectrum antibiotics for 7 days, Group B receives a narrow-spectrum antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria for 7 days, and Group C receives no antibiotics. After treatment, fecal samples are analyzed. Analysis of the local metabolome revealed a 70% decrease in short-chain fatty acid concentrations in Group A, while Groups B and C maintained baseline levels. Additionally, amino acid profiles remained unchanged across all groups. Group A shows a 90% reduction in total bacterial diversity, a 95% decrease in Bacteroidetes, and a 98% decrease in Firmicutes. Group B shows a 60% reduction in Firmicutes, no change in Bacteroidetes, and a 40% reduction in overall diversity. Immune response markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, were measured in all groups and showed a transient 20% increase following antibiotic treatment, returning to baseline within 48 hours. This modulation was independent of the observed changes in microbiota composition. Group C shows no significant changes. All groups are then challenged with oral Salmonella. Microbial diversity in the mouse gut typically ranges from 200 to 500 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) under standard laboratory conditions. Previous studies have shown that shifts in microbial diversity can occur within 48 hours of antibiotic administration, even before major changes in host physiology are detected. Only Group A develops severe Salmonella infection, with high pathogen loads and systemic spread; Group B shows mild infection, and Group C resists colonization.

      "original_question": "A mouse model is used to study gut microbiota dynamics. Mice are divided into three groups: Group A receives broad-spectrum antibiotics for 7 days, Group B receives a narrow-spectrum antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria for 7 days, and Group C receives no antibiotics. After treatment, fecal samples are analyzed. Group A shows a 90% reduction in total bacterial diversity, a 95% decrease in Bacteroidetes, and a 98% decrease in Firmicutes. Group B shows a 60% reduction in Firmicutes, no change in Bacteroidetes, and a 40% reduction in overall diversity. Group C shows no significant changes. All groups are then challenged with oral Salmonella. Only Group A develops severe Salmonella infection, with high pathogen loads and systemic spread; Group B shows mild infection, and Group C resists colonization. Considering the effects of antibiotic spectrum and microbiota composition, which group is most likely to experience dysbiosis-associated loss of colonization resistance?",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Group A) drastically reduce overall diversity and both major phyla.",
        "Narrow-spectrum antibiotics (Group B) mainly affect Firmicutes, less impact on Bacteroidetes.",
        "No antibiotics (Group C) maintain normal microbiota.",
        "Colonization resistance depends on diverse, intact microbiota.",
        "Group A's severe reduction in both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes disrupts colonization resistance.",
        "Group A develops severe Salmonella infection, indicating loss of resistance.",
        "Group B has partial loss, Group C maintains resistance."

Previous studies have shown that shifts in microbial diversity can occur within 48 hours of antibiotic administration, even before major changes in host physiology are detected."

      "question": "A freshwater protozoan predator is introduced into a microcosm containing three bacterial populations: (A) Escherichia coli O157:H7 carrying stx genes on a lambdoid bacteriophage, (B) Shigella dysenteriae 1 lacking stx genes, and (C) E. coli K-12 with no prophages. Activation of the phage lytic cycle in E. coli O157:H7 typically results in a 2- to 5-fold increase in phage particle release within 24 hours. However, the overall bacterial density remains stable under nutrient-rich conditions. After 48 hours, population A shows 80% survival, population B 20% survival, and population C 10% survival. Escherichia coli populations, when exposed to protozoan predation, can increase expression of stress response genes by up to 2-fold, independent of toxin production. In microcosm experiments, E. coli typically maintains a baseline survival rate of 15% without antibiotic intervention. Addition of enrofloxacin to the microcosm increases population A's survival to 95%, but does not affect B or C. A plasmid derived from lambdoid bacteriophage was detected in 60% of E. coli O157:H7 cells after 48 hours, with copy number remaining stable regardless of protozoan presence. This plasmid is commonly used to study horizontal gene transfer in microcosm experiments. Shiga toxin is detected only in population A after enrofloxacin treatment. Which population is responsible for Shiga toxin-mediated defense against protozoan predation under antibiotic stress?",
