      "question": "AML-12 cells (mouse hepatocytes) are exposed to a viral RNA mimic that activates the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway, leading to interferon (IFN) induction. In these cells, DDX3 and PACT are both expressed at similar levels. Sendai virus infection of AML-12 cells results in a 2-fold increase in RIG-I mRNA expression compared to mock-infected controls, but does not alter cell viability over a 24-hour period. Experimental knockdown of DDX3 results in a 90% reduction in IFN production, while knockdown of PACT leads to an 85% reduction. IRF3 phosphorylation levels increase 4-fold in AML-12 cells following exposure to the viral RNA mimic, but total IRF3 protein abundance remains unchanged in both AML-12 and LA-4 cells. In LA-4 cells (mouse lung epithelial), knockdown of DDX3 or PACT does not affect IFN induction. MAVS protein levels remain unchanged in both AML-12 and LA-4 cells following exposure to the viral RNA mimic, and its mitochondrial localization is not affected by DDX3 or PACT knockdown.

      "question": "An experiment is conducted using AML-12 hepatocyte cells to study the induction of interferon in response to RNA virus infection. Three conditions are tested: (1) wild-type AML-12 cells, (2) AML-12 cells with PACT gene knockout, and (3) AML-12 cells with RIG-I gene knockout. MDA-5 expression in AML-12 cells increases 2-fold following RNA virus infection, but this upregulation does not alter baseline cell viability within the first 6 hours. Upon infection with an RNA virus, wild-type cells show a 10-fold increase in interferon mRNA within 6 hours. MDA5 expression levels in AML-12 cells remain unchanged following RNA virus infection, and its activation typically requires the presence of long double-stranded RNA. In previous studies, MDA5 knockout in similar hepatocyte lines did not alter baseline interferon mRNA levels under mock-infected conditions. PACT knockout cells show no increase in interferon mRNA, while RIG-I knockout cells also show no increase. Double-stranded RNA isolated from infected AML-12 cells was found to activate PKR, resulting in a 60% reduction in overall protein synthesis within 8 hours post-infection.

      "question": "A patient with acute viral infection shows elevated levels of both IFN-\u03b2 (type I interferon, 500 pg/mL) and IFN-\u03b3 (type II interferon, 300 pg/mL) in serum. Immune cell analysis reveals high expression of IFNAR (type I interferon receptor) and moderate expression of the receptor for IFN-\u03b3. In parallel assays, IFN-\u03b1 stimulation of patient-derived monocytes resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in IRF7 mRNA expression without significant changes in TNF-\u03b1 levels. Notably, IFN-\u03b1 concentrations in serum remained below 100 pg/mL during the acute phase. TNF-\u03b1 is also present at 200 pg/mL. IRF8 expression in the patient's monocytes was found to be moderately elevated (1.8-fold above baseline), consistent with its known role in regulating cytokine responses during viral infection. Notably, IRF8 protein levels remained stable following combined IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In vitro, stimulation of patient-derived monocytes with IFN-\u03b2 alone leads to robust phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, while IFN-\u03b3 alone induces STAT1 phosphorylation but not STAT2.

Notably, IRF1 expression is also modulated by other inflammatory signals independent of interferon pathways. Combined stimulation with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 results in strong activation of the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 pathway and increased transcription of inflammatory cell death genes.

      "question": "In AML-12 cells, the RNA helicase DDX3 is required for both interferon action and induction, regulating translation of STAT1 and PACT mRNAs. During influenza infection, the viral protein PB1-F2 promotes co-degradation of DDX3, suppressing interferon signaling and increasing viral virulence. In AML-12 cells infected with influenza, IRF7 phosphorylation levels increase by approximately 2-fold within 6 hours of viral entry, independent of changes in IRF3 expression. IRF7 forms heterodimers with IRF3 at a ratio of roughly 1:1 during peak interferon induction. DDX3 interacts with the TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex, acting as a co-factor to promote efficient phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and IRF7, which are essential for IFN1 signaling. In AML-12 cells, activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) leads to a 2.5-fold increase in IFN-\u03b2 mRNA within 6 hours of viral challenge. However, IRF3 phosphorylation levels remain unchanged in the absence of TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex formation. IKK\u03b5 phosphorylates DDX3, activating it to facilitate IRF3 interaction with the TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex.

      "question": "An AML-12 cell line is infected with an RNA virus that produces viral RNA ligands recognized by both RIG-I and MDA-5, activating RLR signaling and leading to IFN-\u03b2 induction. Knockdown of DDX3 in these cells impairs RLR signaling and IFN-\u03b2 production. Type I interferon levels in AML-12 cells typically peak within 6 hours of RNA virus infection, with IFN-\u03b2 accounting for approximately 70% of the total type I interferon produced. This induction is dependent on RLR signaling but can vary with cell metabolic state. Reconstitution with PACT and STAT1 restores the antiviral response.

      "question": "A virus infects human cells and produces long double-stranded RNA during replication. The host cell responds by upregulating PKR expression via interferon signaling. Influenza A virus infection leads to a 2- to 4-fold increase in RIG-I expression in human respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in enhanced production of type I interferons. Despite this, viral replication kinetics remain similar to baseline during the first 12 hours post-infection. PKR activation requires either direct binding to dsRNA, interaction with PACT (which is phosphorylated at S246 and S287), or facilitation by DHX36, which promotes stress granule formation.

      "question": "A country with 95% measles vaccine coverage experiences a sharp decline in measles cases during 2020, coinciding with strict COVID-19 interventions that reduce contact rates by 80%. In 2022, COVID-19 interventions are lifted, but vaccine coverage drops to 85% due to disrupted immunization programs. Waning immunity can lead to a gradual decrease in measles-specific antibody levels, with studies showing that up to 5% of vaccinated individuals may lose detectable immunity over a 10-year period. This phenomenon is observed even in populations with high initial vaccine coverage. Measles virus is highly contagious, with an R\u2080 of 15 in a fully susceptible population. Vaccine refusal rates in the region remained stable at approximately 5% throughout 2020-2022, with surveys indicating that most unvaccinated individuals cited concerns unrelated to access or supply. This behavioral trend has been associated with localized clusters of susceptibility in previous years. The herd immunity threshold for measles is 93%. Population immunity levels can be estimated using serological surveys, which in some regions have shown up to 10% of individuals lack protective antibodies despite reported high vaccine coverage. Waning population immunity may occur over time, especially if booster doses are not administered.

      "question": "A patient presents with acute respiratory symptoms and is diagnosed with a viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with elevated levels of circulating cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, in up to 70% of hospitalized patients. In some cases, viral RNA can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs for more than two weeks after symptom onset. Laboratory tests reveal severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <800 cells/\u03bcL). SARS-CoV infection has been shown to induce a marked increase in serum IL-6 levels within the first week of illness, with peak concentrations correlating to disease severity. In experimental models, SARS-CoV replicates efficiently in human airway epithelial cells, reaching viral titers exceeding 10^6 PFU/mL by day 3 post-infection. Three possible mechanisms are considered: (1) direct viral suppression of lymphocyte counts as seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) activation of STING pathway leading to lymphocyte activation and enhanced adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and (3) rapid lymphocyte-based invasion of mucosal tissue by measles virus facilitated by the V protein, which enhances viral spread and pathogenesis. Measles virus infection is associated with a transient viremia phase during which viral RNA can be detected in peripheral blood at levels exceeding 10^4 copies/mL. In unvaccinated individuals, measles virus can cause a characteristic rash and fever within 10\u201314 days of exposure. Given the laboratory finding of lymphopenia and immune dysregulation, which mechanism is most consistent with the observed clinical and laboratory features?",

      "question": "A cohort of 100 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is analyzed for lymphocyte subset percentages. In healthy controls, CD4+ T cells comprise 40% of lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells 30%, B cells 20%, and NK cells 10%. In SARS patients, CD4+ T cells drop to 20%, CD8+ T cells to 10%, B cells to 5%, and NK cells to 5%. SARS-CoV is known to infect respiratory epithelial cells but does not directly infect lymphocytes. However, high levels of circulating IL-6 (200 pg/mL vs. Measles virus infection is associated with a transient lymphopenia, with CD4+ T cell counts dropping by up to 60% during acute disease. Unlike SARS-CoV, measles virus directly infects lymphocytes via the CD150 receptor. 10 pg/mL in controls) and TNF-\u03b1 (100 pg/mL vs. 5 pg/mL in controls) are detected in patients. Both cytokines induce apoptosis in lymphocytes. Which mechanism most likely explains the observed lymphocyte subset reductions in SARS patients?",
