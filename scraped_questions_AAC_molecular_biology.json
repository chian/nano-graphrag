      "question": "A patient is diagnosed with mpox caused by a viral strain confirmed through sequencing to belong to clade IIb. This strain is associated with recent outbreaks and is known to spread efficiently between humans. The Y258C mutation in the sF13 gene has been observed in approximately 12% of clade IIb isolates from recent outbreaks, altering the homodimer interface without impacting overall viral replication rates. The patient is immunocompromised and at high risk for severe disease. Cidofovir demonstrates an EC50 of 2.52 \u03bcg/mL against orthopoxviruses in human embryonic lung fibroblasts, with a selectivity index of 15. In animal studies, cidofovir is typically administered via intraperitoneal injection to assess its antiviral efficacy. Two antiviral options are considered: (1) Tecovirimat, which inhibits viral dissemination in clade IIb infections, and (2) Cidofovir, which inhibits viral DNA polymerase but has significant nephrotoxicity and is less effective against recent outbreak strains. The VP37:N267del mutation, which results in the deletion of asparagine at position 267 in the VP37 protein, has been identified in approximately 8% of sequenced mpox isolates from recent outbreaks. This variant has been observed in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Both drugs are available, but minimizing side effects and maximizing efficacy against the specific viral clade are priorities. Which antiviral should be selected for this patient?",

      "question": "A researcher is studying host restriction factors that inhibit HIV replication. In an in vitro assay, human cells expressing a cytidine deaminase enzyme show a 90% reduction in HIV infectivity compared to control cells. Sequencing of viral genomes from these cells reveals a high frequency of G-to-A mutations. When the viral Vif protein is co-expressed, HIV infectivity returns to control levels and G-to-A mutations are no longer observed. The researcher tests three candidate host proteins: APOBEC3, TRIM5\u03b1, and Tetherin. Only one candidate is known to induce cytidine deamination, leading to G-to-A hypermutation, and is specifically counteracted by Vif.

      "question": "A virology lab is testing antiviral strategies against monkeypox virus using a cell culture system. The virus requires the F13 protein for envelopment and release of extracellular virions. In wild-type virus-infected cells, 95% of virions are released extracellularly. VP37 protein levels in infected cells peak at 18 hours post-infection, coinciding with maximal extracellular virion release. In the absence of VP37, intracellular mature virions accumulate but are not efficiently transported to the cell surface. In F13-knockout virus, only 5% of virions are released. When F13-knockout virus infects a cell line constitutively expressing the F13L gene, extracellular virion release is restored to 90%. Vaccinia virus p37 shares 85% sequence identity with monkeypox virus F13 and is similarly required for efficient extracellular virion formation. In infected cells, p37 localizes to the trans-Golgi network and interacts with host Rab9 for vesicle trafficking. Tecovirimat at 10 \u03bcM reduces extracellular virion release by 90% in wild-type virus but has no effect on F13-knockout virus. A mutant virus with a tecovirimat resistance-associated mutation in F13 shows only 10% reduction in extracellular virion release when treated with tecovirimat. F13L protein localizes predominantly to the trans-Golgi network in infected cells, with peak expression observed at 8 hours post-infection. In immunofluorescence assays, F13L co-localizes with viral membrane markers in over 85% of infected cells. ST-246 at 10 \u03bcM reduces extracellular virion release by 90% in both wild-type and tecovirimat-resistant mutant viruses. Which antiviral compound should be prioritized to inhibit extracellular virion release in the tecovirimat-resistant mutant?",

      "question": "A clinical trial evaluates four interventions for severe Mpox in immunocompromised adults: (1) tecovirimat monotherapy, (2) cidofovir monotherapy, (3) JYNNEOS vaccination post-exposure, and (4) combined tecovirimat plus cidofovir. Tecovirimat inhibits the VP37 protein, blocking viral maturation and spread, but some severe cases are unresponsive due to rapid viral evolution and possible resistance mutations. The VP37:N267del mutation, which deletes asparagine at position 267 in the VP37 protein, was identified in 12% of trial participants and is linked to decreased susceptibility to tecovirimat. This mutation has been observed in multiple recent mpox outbreaks. Cidofovir acts as a nucleotide analogue, reducing viral replication, and is used when tecovirimat is insufficient. Recombinant IFNs, when administered alongside standard antivirals, have been shown in preliminary studies to increase interferon-stimulated gene expression by 2.5-fold in immunocompromised patients with Mpox. However, their impact on clinical outcomes in this population remains under investigation. JYNNEOS induces protective immunity but is less effective post-exposure in immunocompromised patients. Brincidofovir, a lipid-conjugated derivative of cidofovir, demonstrated a 65% reduction in MPXV viral load in preclinical models, though gastrointestinal side effects were reported in 40% of subjects. In the trial, 60% of patients on tecovirimat alone showed no improvement, while 80% on cidofovir alone had reduced viral load but persistent symptoms.

VP37, the envelope protein targeted by tecovirimat, is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and is expressed at peak levels approximately 8 hours post-infection in vitro.

Microbiota composition analysis revealed that mice treated with enrofloxacin retained over 80% of baseline microbial diversity, while infection alone reduced diversity by approximately 25%. Changes in microbiota composition were most pronounced in the ileum compared to the colon. Four antibiotics are tested: (1) Enrofloxacin inhibits infection but does not prevent Shiga toxin-mediated organ damage and minimally disrupts the intestinal microbiota; (2) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole inhibits infection, does not prevent organ damage, and is also minimally disruptive to the microbiota; (3) Kanamycin inhibits and rapidly clears infection, prevents organ damage, and does not disrupt the microbiota; (4) Tetracycline inhibits and rapidly clears infection, causes minimal organ damage, but severely reduces microbiota diversity. Following antibiotic treatment, microbial diversity in the gut can decrease by up to 70%, with certain taxa such as Lactobacillus and Bacteroides being disproportionately affected. However, total bacterial load may remain unchanged despite shifts in community composition. Dysbiosis, defined as a significant reduction in microbial diversity and altered community structure, can be quantified by a 40% decrease in Shannon diversity index following broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. In mouse models, dysbiosis is often accompanied by increased susceptibility to secondary infections, independent of primary pathogen clearance.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes, such as those encoded by blaCTX-M, hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) often exceeding 10^5 M^-1s^-1. However, ESBL production does not alter susceptibility to aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones. The isolate carries genes encoding the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump and a plasmid-borne blaCTX-M \u03b2-lactamase. The carbapenemase OXA-48 enzyme, when present, can hydrolyze meropenem with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of approximately 1,000 M\u207b\u00b9s\u207b\u00b9. Its gene is often detected in hospital-associated E. coli strains during outbreaks but was not identified in this isolate. The patient has a history of severe allergic reaction to penicillins and cephalosporins. Horizontal gene transfer can facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among Enterobacteriaceae, with rates estimated at up to 10^-7 events per cell per generation under laboratory conditions.

Group A receives an antibiotic that induces the bacterial SOS response, while Group B receives an antibiotic that does not affect the SOS response.

In laboratory conditions, MDR1B overexpression has been associated with increased efflux activity but does not always correlate with higher MIC values. parapsilosis contains an assembly error that artificially fuses CDR1B, but this isolate\u2019s genome is correctly assembled. Copy number variation (CNV) events have been documented to increase the copy number of drug transporter genes by up to 4-fold in Candida species exposed to azole antifungals.

      "question": "A fungal pathogen possesses three CDR (Candida Drug Resistance) genes: CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. Each gene encodes an ABC transporter that exports azole drugs, conferring resistance. In a clinical isolate, genomic analysis reveals a tandem array of CDR1 and CDR2, with a chimeric CDR gene formed by fusion of the 5' region of CDR1 and the 3' region of CDR2. Copy number analysis using CPAR2_304370 as a reference gene indicated a stable genomic baseline across all isolates. No significant variation in CPAR2_304370 expression was observed under azole treatment. Expression analysis shows: CDR1 (not detected), CDR2 (not detected), CDR3 (normal), chimeric CDR (highly expressed). The chimeric CDR protein retains the nucleotide-binding domain of CDR1 and the transmembrane domain of CDR2. In some isolates, the CDR1B.1/CDR1B.2 chimeric gene is expressed at levels up to 10-fold higher than either parental gene, yet its substrate specificity remains similar to CDR1B.2. Drug susceptibility testing shows: fluconazole MIC = 64 \u03bcg/mL (resistant), voriconazole MIC = 8 \u03bcg/mL (resistant), amphotericin B MIC = 0. 5 \u03bcg/mL (susceptible). Which genetic mechanism most likely explains the high-level azole resistance in this isolate?",
