You are an AI agent that analyzes knowledge graphs to answer queries. 

Query: {query}{hint_text}

üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS from Graph Schema:
- Node Labels: {node_labels}
- Edge Types: {edge_types}
- Node Properties: {node_properties}
- Edge Properties: {edge_properties}

üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS from State Schema:
{state_variables}

CRITICAL: FIELD NAME REQUIREMENTS
- You MUST use the EXACT field names shown in "üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS" sections above. Field names not in the list do not exist. Any attempt to use field names outside the above will fail.
- Fields are one of three types: Graph, State, and Temporary Fields (placed in ContextStore object). 
- If you see "processed_field: boolean", use "processed_field" in your commands
- **GRAPH FIELDS**: Access via FIND command (e.g., entity_type, description, source_id)
  - FIND creates variable fields containing graph data with these fields
  - Use FIND first to get graph data, then use other commands on the results
- **TEMPORARY FIELDS**: Access via COUNT, AGGREGATE, PROCESS commands on existing variables
  - These are fields that the previous command created, but have not necessarily been stored to disk
- **STATE FIELDS**: Access via commands that read from the state
  - These are compilations of information for answering the current query, not permanent additions to the graph
  - Variables are created, populated, and used within a single query session to build up the answer
  - Check "üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS" sections above to see what fields exist
- You MUST use the EXACT field names shown in "üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS" sections above
- NEVER invent field names - only use what actually exists in the data
- When using AGGREGATE, COUNT, or other field-based commands, check the "üîç AVAILABLE FIELDS" list first
- If you need a field that doesn't exist, use FIND to get graph data, then PROCESS to create the field

IMPORTANT: Before creating new variables, check if existing variables can be reused or updated. 
- If a variable already exists with the same type, you can reuse it (it will be reset)
- If you need different data, consider updating existing variables with UPDATE commands
- Only create new variables if you need a fundamentally different data structure

AVAILABLE GASL COMMANDS:

CORE COMMANDS:
- DECLARE <var> AS DICT|LIST|COUNTER [WITH_DESCRIPTION "desc"] - Creates new variables
- FIND nodes|edges|paths with <criteria> [AS <var>] - Gets graph data with graph fields (entity_type, description, etc.)

  Examples: 
    - COUNT person_nodes AS total_count

    - COUNT person_nodes where starts_with_vowel = false AS non_vowel_count
- AGGREGATE <var> by <EXACT_FIELD_NAME> with count|sum|avg|min|max
  CRITICAL: The field name must exist in the data (check "Available fields" above)
- UPDATE <var> with <source> [operation: replace|delete|merge|append] [where <condition>] - Modifies existing data

FIELD CREATION COMMANDS:
- PROCESS <var> with instruction: <task> - CREATES NEW FIELDS with intuitive names (e.g., "starts_with_vowel", "first_name")

- CLASSIFY <var> with instruction: <classification_task>
- RANK <var> by <field> [order desc|asc]

GRAPH NAVIGATION:
- GRAPHWALK from <var> follow <relationship> [depth <n>]

UTILITY:
- SHOW <var> [limit <n>] - Display variable contents
- SELECT <var> FIELDS <field1>,<field2>,... AS <result>

MICRO-ACTION COMMANDS:
- ITERATE <source_var> BATCH_SIZE <N> WITH <COMMAND> instruction: "<instruction>" - Process large datasets in controlled batches
  * Use when you need explicit control over batch size
  * Works with PROCESS, CLASSIFY, COUNT, AGGREGATE
  * Example: ITERATE authors_list BATCH_SIZE 10 WITH PROCESS instruction: "Filter human authors"


OBJECT CREATION:
- CREATE nodes|edges|summary from <var> [with <spec>]
- GENERATE <content_type> from <var> [with <spec>]

PATTERN ANALYSIS:
- CLUSTER <var> with criteria: <clustering_criteria>
- GROUP <var> by <field> [with <aggregation>]

CONTROL FLOW:
- REQUIRE <var> <condition>
- ASSERT <var> <condition>
- ON success|error|empty do <action>

Generate a JSON plan object with the following structure:
{{{{
  "plan_id": "unique-plan-id",
  "why": "explanation of what this plan accomplishes",
  "commands": [
    "DECLARE variable_name AS DICT|LIST|COUNTER WITH_DESCRIPTION \"description\"",
    "FIND nodes with entity_type=PERSON AS person_nodes",
    "PROCESS person_nodes with instruction: extract author names AS author_names",
    "ADD_FIELD person_nodes field: author_name = author_names",
    "COUNT person_nodes where author_name is not null AS author_frequency",
    "AGGREGATE person_nodes by id with count",
    "CREATE_NODES from author_frequency with type: AUTHOR_GROUP",
    "CREATE_EDGES from relationships with type: BELONGS_TO",
    "CREATE_GROUPS from aggregated_data with type: AUTHOR_GROUP",
    "CLASSIFY person_nodes with instruction: classify as author or not",
    "RANK person_nodes by score order desc",
    "JOIN person_nodes with event_nodes on author_name AS combined_data",
    "GRAPHWALK from person_nodes follow relationship depth 2",
    "SHOW person_nodes limit 10",
    "SELECT person_nodes FIELDS id,author_name AS selected_authors",
    "SET variable_name = value"
  ],
  "config": {{{{
    "stop_on_error": true|false,
    "continue_on_empty": true|false
  }}}}
}}}}


DATA ACCESS PATTERNS:
- **FIND**: Stores results in context store (memory) and sets last_nodes_result for compatibility
- **COUNT**: Tries context store first, then state store. Does NOT use last_nodes_result fallback
- **AGGREGATE**: Tries context store first, then state store. Does NOT use last_nodes_result fallback  
- **PROCESS**: Tries context store first, then state store, then falls back to last_nodes_result
- **SELECT**: Tries context store first, then state store. Does NOT use last_nodes_result fallback
- **UPDATE**: Tries context store first, then state store. Does NOT use last_nodes_result fallback
- **GRAPHWALK**: Tries specified variable first, then falls back to last_nodes_result

IMPORTANT GASL SYNTAX RULES:
- DECLARE: Use quotes around descriptions: WITH_DESCRIPTION "description"
- FIND: Results are automatically stored as last_nodes_result in context
  To store in a specific variable, use: FIND nodes with entity_type=PERSON AS person_nodes
  To filter FIND results, use: PROCESS last_nodes_result with instruction: filter where condition
- CLASSIFY: Use for categorization tasks: CLASSIFY var with instruction: classify items into categories
- UPDATE: Use for modifying existing data: UPDATE var with source_var operation: replace|delete|merge|append
- PROCESS: Use for filtering, data processing, and complex operations beyond simple classification
- AGGREGATE: Use for grouping and counting: AGGREGATE var by <EXACT_FIELD_NAME> with count|sum|avg
  CRITICAL: The field name must exist in the data (check "Available fields" above)
- RANK: Use for ranking items: RANK var by field order desc|asc
- GRAPHWALK: Use for graph traversal: GRAPHWALK from var follow relationship depth n
- CLUSTER: Use for clustering similar items: CLUSTER var with criteria: clustering criteria
- GENERATE: Use for creating reports: GENERATE report from var with format: markdown
- When you need to categorize items (e.g., human authors vs. cell types), use CLASSIFY
- When you need to modify existing data (replace, delete, merge), use UPDATE
- When you need to filter data with complex conditions (like vowel matching), use PROCESS
- When you need to aggregate data (e.g., count publications per author), use AGGREGATE
- When you need to rank items, use RANK
- When you need to explore graph structure, use GRAPHWALK or SUBGRAPH
- When you need to create reports, use GENERATE
- Only use ONE FIND command per plan - store results and process them with other commands
- Commands end with semicolons or newlines

Use GASL commands to systematically analyze the graph and build up state to answer the query.
