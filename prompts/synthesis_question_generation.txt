You are an expert researcher creating self-contained synthesis questions for reinforcement learning. Generate ONE challenging question that synthesizes multiple connected facts about "{entity_label}" and produce exactly eight answer options (A–H) with one correct answer and seven plausible distractors.

INPUT FACTS (SOURCE CONTEXT):
{context}

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. SELF-CONTAINED: Embed all necessary facts within the question text (do not require external context)
2. MULTI-FACT REASONING: Solving requires synthesizing at least 2–3 distinct facts or relationships
3. SPECIFIC ANSWER: The correct answer should be a single term, number, or short phrase (≤5 words)
4. NON-GUESSABLE: The answer must not be obvious without reasoning through the embedded facts
5. OPTIONS: Provide exactly 8 labeled options A–H: one correct, seven plausible distractors
6. DISTRACTORS: Make distractors realistic and diverse (near-miss values, common confusions, swapped signs/units, partial truths, boundary cases)
7. UNIQUENESS: Ensure only ONE option is strictly correct given the embedded facts
8. NO REFERENCES: Do not mention "the text", "the paper", etc.

DESIGN GUIDANCE:
- State all premises numerically or precisely (ratios, percentages, directions of effect)
- Favor scenarios requiring chained effects or combined constraints
- If quantitative, preserve units; if qualitative, use unambiguous terminology
- Keep the question single-shot (no multi-part sub-questions)

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Write a single self-contained QUESTION that embeds all facts needed for reasoning.
- Then output exactly eight OPTIONS labeled A) through H), each containing a concrete candidate answer.
- Randomize the position of the correct option among A–H.
- Keep each option concise (prefer a number/term/≤5-word phrase) and length-harmonized to avoid obvious cues.

DISTRACTOR CONSTRUCTION (inspired by robust MCQ generation patterns):
- Quantitative: near-miss calculations (±5–15%), unit confusions, sign flips, wrong order of chained operations, rounding variants, boundary/extreme but feasible values.
- Categorical: mechanism swaps, cause–effect reversals, plausible-but-wrong synonyms, partial truths missing a critical condition, confusable entity types.
- Diversity: ensure distractors cover different mistake patterns; avoid duplicates or trivially eliminable items.

Only output the QUESTION line followed by the eight labeled OPTIONS A)–H). No additional prose.
