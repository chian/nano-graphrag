You are an expert researcher specializing in creating challenging questions that test deep understanding and reasoning abilities. Your task is to generate ONE exceptional, self-contained question that embeds the necessary facts for reasoning.

CONTENT (SOURCE FACTS):
{chunk_text}

TASK: Transform the relevant facts from the content into ONE question that emphasizes logic, reasoning, and critical thinking.

QUESTION REQUIREMENTS (must satisfy ALL):
1. DIFFICULTY: Challenging for intermediate to advanced researchers
2. LOGIC-ORIENTED: Requires systematic reasoning, not recall
3. SELF-CONTAINED: Restate all necessary facts within the question text (do not reference external text)
4. REASONING-DEMANDING: Not answerable by simple factual lookup; requires chaining facts or performing calculations
5. SPECIFIC ANSWER: The correct answer should be a precise number, specific term, or short phrase (ideally 1 word/number)
6. NON-GUESSABLE: Avoid yes/no or true/false; design so the answer demands working through the embedded facts

PREFERRED QUESTION TYPES (choose the most challenging option):
- CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Challenge methodology, assumptions, or conclusions with concrete technical constraints
- MECHANISTIC REASONING: How/why questions requiring step-by-step logical derivation
- LIMITATION ANALYSIS: Identify constraints, boundaries, or failure modes given the stated conditions
- COMPARATIVE REASONING: Contrast approaches or quantify trade-offs using provided quantities/relations
- APPLICATION CHALLENGES: Apply given relationships in multi-step scenarios to compute a specific outcome

QUESTION DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Start with sophisticated framing: "How would you reconcile...", "What explains the apparent contradiction between...", "Given the constraints, what is..."
- Explicitly embed all relevant facts as premises inside the question
- Prefer counterfactuals or parametric variations: "If X increases by 10% while Y halves, what is Z?"
- Make multi-step logic unavoidable (at least 2â€“3 steps)
- Demand evaluation of evidence quality or causal strength when qualitative; otherwise favor quantitative derivations
- Avoid any references to the source text (e.g., "this paper", "the authors", "the model")

NUMERICAL/QUANTITATIVE GUIDANCE (when applicable):
- Provide concrete numbers/ratios/percentages inside the question
- If chaining effects, clearly specify each step (e.g., A increases B by 30%, B reduces C by 40%)
- Ask for the final numeric value or exact relationship (e.g., "net change in C (%)")
- If units appear in the facts, preserve them in the question

STRUCTURE TEMPLATE (adapt as needed; include the facts inside the question):
- "Given that [fact 1], [fact 2], and [fact 3], what is the [specific numeric/term] for [target] under [counterfactual/constraint]?"
- "If [entity] with [property X] influences [A] by [p%], and [A] influences [B] by [q%], then when [X changes by r%], what is the resulting [exact numeric/term] for [B]?"
- "Considering [constraints and relationships stated explicitly], which single [method/term/value] satisfies all conditions?"

QUALITY CHECKLIST (ensure before finalizing):
- The question fully restates the necessary premises (no missing context)
- The answer space is narrow (ideally one number/term)
- Solving requires at least two reasoning steps or a calculation
- No yes/no, no vague phrasing, no references to the source text

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
QUESTION_TYPE: [type from the preferred types above]
DIFFICULTY: advanced
QUESTION: [Write only the final, self-contained question text]

Focus on creating a question that would require an expert to engage in systematic, rigorous reasoning to answer properly.
