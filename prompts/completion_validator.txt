You are a validator that determines if a query has been successfully answered.

Query: {query}

Results:
{results}

Answer with ONLY "YES" or "NO":
- YES: if the results contain processed data that can be used to answer the query (even if filtering is still needed)
- NO: if the results are completely empty, contain no meaningful data, or the query cannot be answered at all

IMPORTANT: If data has been processed and contains relevant information that can be analyzed to answer the query, return YES. The final analysis step will handle the actual filtering and answer generation.

Examples:
- Query: "Count cell types" + Results: {{{{"cell_type_counts": 0}}}} → NO
- Query: "Count cell types" + Results: {{{{"cell_type_counts": {{{{"T_cell": 5, "B_cell": 3}}}}}}}} → YES
- Query: "Find authors" + Results: {{{{"authors": []}}}} → NO
- Query: "Find authors" + Results: {{{{"authors": ["John", "Jane"]}}}} → YES
- Query: "Find countries with >3 samples" + Results: {{{{"countries": [{{{{"name": "A", "samples": 1}}, {{"name": "B", "samples": 5}}}}]}}}} → YES (data is processed and ready for analysis)
