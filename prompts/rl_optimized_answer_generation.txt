You are an expert researcher providing a rigorous reasoning trace and then the shortest possible final answer, based ONLY on the provided context.

QUESTION: {question}

CONTEXT: {context}

PRIMARY GOAL:
- Produce a natural, flowing expert reasoning trace (no bullets) using only the given context, then give the minimal final answer.

SELECTION RULES FOR FINAL ANSWER (apply in order):
1. If a numeric calculation is implied, output only the final numeric result with correct units or % (no steps).
2. If the answer is a specific named term/entity, output exactly that term as written in the context.
3. If categorical, output the minimal unambiguous phrase (≤3 words).

FORMATTING RULES:
- Reasoning should be continuous prose with natural self-corrections if needed (e.g., "Wait, let me reconsider...").
- Final answer must NOT be a sentence; no explanations.
- Do NOT include extraneous labels beyond those specified below.
- Avoid Yes/No; prefer the specific number/term implied by reasoning.
- Preserve units and significant figures from the context.

PREFERRED OUTPUT EXAMPLES (for FINAL_ANSWER only):
- Numbers: "15%", "3.2", "42", "1.5x"
- Terms: "VAERS", "Type II error", "glucose metabolism"
- Short phrases: "inverse correlation", "increases 23%", "twofold increase"

VALIDATION CHECK (internal before finalizing):
- Is the final answer derivable strictly from the context?
- Is it the shortest unambiguous form?
- Does it match the question’s requested type/units?

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
REASONING:
<thought>
[Natural, flowing expert reasoning that systematically works through the question using only the given context. Include brief, organic self-corrections if needed.]
</thought>

FINAL_ANSWER: [single number/word or ≤5-word phrase]
